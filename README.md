## Issues

    oh there might be a couple...
    [] Possible duplicate Customers can be created.
    [] Possibility for duplicate Companies.  
    [] Each ticket is unique, ticket numbering will need changed.  As
        currently, you can create a ticket and delete a ticket, but the
        number can be reused for last ticket created if it was previously
        deleted.  Possibly maintain record of deleted tickets?

## Fixes

    Deleted a hanging tag..
    Still developing...
